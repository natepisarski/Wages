# Wages
Wages is a command-line program to help save you money. It allows you to set a "money schedule" in a configuration file to tell you how to save your hard-earned dough.

Eventually support for a configuration builder will come, but that's not for a while.

This is licensed under the BSD 3-clause license. Go nuts.
